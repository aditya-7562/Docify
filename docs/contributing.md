# Contributing Guide

We welcome community contributions. Standard workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`.
3. Implement your changes and add tests when applicable.
4. Run `npm test` (and `npm run lint` if needed).
5. Commit (`git commit -m "Add amazing feature"`) and push.
6. Open a Pull Request for review.

## Development Guidelines

- Favor clear TypeScript types and meaningful names.
- Document complex logic with concise comments.
- Mirror the existing coding style and linting rules.
- Write or update tests for new features/bug fixes.
- Update docs when behavior changes.
